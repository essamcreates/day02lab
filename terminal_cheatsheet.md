# Terminal commands cheatsheet

This is a terminal cheatsheet for my own use

## Terminal commands

| Command | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `command pwd` | stands for print working directory - tells you where you are in the terminal |
| `ls` | lists all of the things we have, bright blue for folders and the files or extensions in white |
|`ctrl + l`| clears the screen - it does **NOT** delete the code on the screen, just moves the cursor to the top again|
|`ls -l`|this is a flaf, which shows a detailed list of the folders and files. Will be used on occasion|
|`ls -a`|shows hidden files that we don't want the average everyday user to mess with, otherwise might break stuff|
|`-la or -al`|flags can be combined to -la or -al|
|`cd (+) name of file`|change directory to go to the folder you have stated **if you type in cd by itself, it will take you back to the home direcory. It does not matter where you are (get out of jail card)**|
|`cd + (letters) + tab key`|will show you the folder options which start with the letters you type in. If you keep hitting the tab it will highlight a specific folder for you as you go along. If you press enter on a specific folder it will take you. Will be useful when you have very complicated long folder name.|
|`cd ..`|this will take you to the folder above in the file tree, one level up. **cd** by itself will take you to the home directory|
|`mkdir + space + name of folder`|make directory|
|**snake formatting**|need underscore because otherwise it will make three separate folders, e.g. 'my second folder' - one for my, one for second, one for folder|
